********************************Singly Linked Lists****************************

Objectives
1. Define what a Singly Linked List is
2. Compare and contrast Linked Lists with Arrays
3. Implement insertion, removal and traversal methods on Singly Linked Lists


1. What is a linked list?
A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.

Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

*****************************Comparisons with Arrays***************************

        Lists 
a. Do not have indexes!
b. Connected via nodes with a next pointer
c. Random access is not allowed


        Arrays
a. Indexed in order!
b. Insertion and deletion can be expensive
c. Can quickly be accessed at a specific index


***********************************RECAP***************************************
1.Singly Linked Lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required
2. Arrays contain a built in index whereas Linked Lists do not
3. The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like Stacks and Queues
