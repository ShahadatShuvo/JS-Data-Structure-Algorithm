// How we'll be using classes
// class DataStructure(){
//     constructor(){
//         // what default properties should it have?
//     }
//     someInstanceMethod(){
//         // what should each object created from this class be able to do?
//     }
// }
// We will almost never be using static methods

// One gotcha with `this`
// Inside all of our instance methods and constructor, the keyword `this` refers to the object created from that class (also known as an instance)

// *********************************Recap*********************************
// 1. Classes are blueprints that when created make objects known as instances
// 2. Classes are created with the new keyword
// 3. The constructor function is a special function that gets run when the class is instantiated
// 4. Instance methods can be added to classes similar to methods in objects
// 5. Class methods can be added using the static keyword
